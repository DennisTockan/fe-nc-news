Welcome to the NC News Forum! This project represents my inaugural journey into the world of full-stack development. Over the course of two intense weeks, I gave my all into crafting a news forum application powered by JavaScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL for the backend, and React for the frontend.

## Project Overview
NC News Forum is a dynamic web application designed to facilitate engaging discussions and the sharing of news articles spanning various topics. It serves as a platform for meaningful conversations and a reliable source of updates on current events. This project stands as a testament to the strides I've made as a software developer, with rapid progress and newfound expertise in JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, and React.

## Technologies & Development Tools
### Technologies Used:
- JavaScript - Used for server-side and client-side scripting.
- HTML - Markup language for creating web pages.
- CSS - Styling language for designing the user interface.
- PostgreSQL - Relational database for data storage.
- React (with hooks) - JavaScript library for building the frontend.
- Axios - HTTP client for making API requests.
- Material UI - UI framework for building a modern and responsive user interface.

### Development Tools
- VS Code - Code editor for development.
- Git - Version control system for tracking changes.
- Github - Platform for hosting and collaborating on code.
- Insomnia - API testing tool for debugging and testing API endpoints.

## Getting Started
### Clone Instructions:
---
If you would like to run this project locally, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DennisTockan/be-nc-news.git
```

2. Navigate into the repository folder using
```
cd be-nc-news
```

3. Open your new repository in VSCode:
```
code .
```

### Installation of Dependencies:
---

Install all the required dependencies listed in the package.json file by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install
```

### Environment Variables Setup:
---
Two new files will need to be created in the main directory. Name these two files `.env.test` and  `.env.development`.

#### Inside .env.test:
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```

#### Inside .env.development:
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```

Make sure to include both .env files in your .gitignore to keep sensitive data safe.

### Proceed to Run Setup Scripts and Begin Development
---
1. Seed the local database:
```
npm run setup-dbs
```
2. Seed the database with initial data:
```
npm run seed
```
3. For seeding the production database with data:
```
npm run seed-prod
```

### Running Tests:
---
Execute Jest test suites using the following command, optionally providing an identifier for the file containing test suites to run:
```
npm test OPTIONAL_IDENTIFIER
```

## The Approach
### The Application Programming Interface (API)
---

The primary object for the backend project is to establish and create my very own robust RESTful API. This API has been meticulously designed to provide a wide range of endpoints, all of which integrate with the frontend news media web service. These endpoints empower users by giving them the ability to interact with and manage the data stored within the PostgreSQL database.

This level of interaction is made possible through the incorporation of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations. These allow users to not only access but also manipulate the data according to their individual requirements and preferences. In essence, this API serves a flexible and dynamic bridge between users and the underlying database, enabling them to shape and customize the data to suit their specific needs.

### Defining my MVP
---
Before getting started on building API for the backend, I had to decide on the core functionality that I thought would be essential for the project to be useful and valuable. 

The MVP aimed to deliver essential features necessary for a fully functional News Forum: 
- Getting All Articles 
- Filtering Artilces by Category
- Posting and Deleting Comments 
- Upvoting and Downvoting Articles

I decided to use Trello to create, visualise and organise the tickets for my project required in my MVP. After several iterations, this was the decided tickets for my project.

### Express
---
In this project, I leveraged the Express.js framework, a powerful and widely adopted Node.js framework, to simplify and streamline the development of our backend. Express provides us with a robust set of tools and features for rdefining routes and handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT & DELETE) making it an ideal choice for building RESTful APIs. 

```
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

const { getAllTopics } = require("./controllers/topics.controllers");

const { getAllApiEndpoints } = require("./controllers/api.controllers");

const {
  getArticleById,
  getAllArticles,
  getArticleIdComments,
  postArticleIdComment,
  patchArticleIdsArticle
} = require("./controllers/articles.controllers");

const { deletedComment } = require("./controllers/comment.controller");

const { getAllUsers } = require("./controllers/users.controllers")

const {
  handlePsqlErrors,
  handleCustomErrors,
  handleServersErrors,
} = require("./errors");

app.use(express.json()); 

app.use(cors());

app.get("/api/topics", getAllTopics);
app.get("/api/", getAllApiEndpoints);
app.get("/api/articles", getAllArticles);
app.get("/api/articles/:article_id", getArticleById)
app.get("/api/articles/:article_id/comments", getArticleIdComments);
app.patch("/api/articles/:article_id", patchArticleIdsArticle);
app.post("/api/articles/:article_id/comments", postArticleIdComment);
app.delete("/api/comments/:comment_id", deletedComment);
app.get("/api/users", getAllUsers);
app.use(handlePsqlErrors);
app.use(handleCustomErrors);
app.use(handleServersErrors);
module.exports = app;
```

### Model View Controller
---
The project adopted the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern to efficiently manage various aspects of the application, categorising the functions to make the codebase neat and managable. 

The MVC Flow chart is a visual representation of the structure the backend project follows:

#### MVC separates responsibilities into distinct components:

- Controller: Handles client requests, utilizes request information to interact with the model, and responds to the client with relevant data.

- Model: Manages data operations like retrieval, updating, creation, and deletion, delivering data to the controller in the required format.
